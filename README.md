The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) spearheads the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) nationwide. The survey, which is undertaken every three years, is aimed at providing data on family income and expenditure, including levels of consumption by item of expenditure. Our data, from the 2015 FIES, is a subset of 1500 of the 40,000 observations (Philippine Statistics Authority 2015). Our data set focuses on five regions: Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Ilocos, Davao, and Visayas

Each line of the data file refers to a household at the time of the survey:
Description of variable
location = where the house is located (Central Luzon, Davao Region, Ilocos Region, Metro Manila, or Visayas)
age = the age of the head of household
total = the number of people in the household other than the head
numLT5 = the number in the household under 5 years of age
roof = the type of roof in the household (either Predominantly Light/Salvaged Material, or Predominantly Strong Material, where stronger material can sometimes be used as a proxy for greater wealth)
