Repository for my biostatistics & data management teaching courses.

This repository was created for team teaching collaboration in developing materials, code, and dataset for the biostatistics classes. This is not replacing LIVE UNPAD as LMS but rather a complementary tools for sharing materials, codes, dan datasets.

There would be three courses related with this site: 
1. Basic Biostatistics (Code: BB)
2. Advance Biostatistics (Code: AB)
3. Data Management and Analysis with R (Code: DM)

The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) spearheads the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) nationwide. The survey, which is undertaken every three years, is aimed at providing data on family income and expenditure, including levels of consumption by item of expenditure. Our data, from the 2015 FIES, is a subset of 1500 of the 40,000 observations (Philippine Statistics Authority 2015). Our data set focuses on five regions: Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Ilocos, Davao, and Visayas

Each line of the data file refers to a household at the time of the survey:
Description of variable
location = where the house is located (Central Luzon, Davao Region, Ilocos Region, Metro Manila, or Visayas)
age = the age of the head of household
total = the number of people in the household other than the head
numLT5 = the number in the household under 5 years of age
roof = the type of roof in the household (either Predominantly Light/Salvaged Material, or Predominantly Strong Material, where stronger material can sometimes be used as a proxy for greater wealth)

   Description
3154 healthy young men aged 39-59 from the San Francisco area were assessed for their personality

later change in this situation was recorded.
Format
A data frame with 3154 observations on the following 13 variables.
age= age in years;
height= height in inches;
weight= weight in pounds;
sdp= systolic blood pressure in mm Hg;
dbp= diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg;
chol= Fasting serum cholesterol in mm %;
behave= behavior type which is a factor with levels A1 A2 B3 B4;
cigs= number of cigarettes smoked per day;
dibep= behavior type a factor with levels A (Agressive) B (Passive);
chd= coronary heat disease developed is a factor with levels no yes;
typechd= type of coronary heart disease is a factor with levels angina infdeath none silent;
timechd= Time of CHD event or end of follow-up;
arcus= arcus senilis is a factor with levels absent present.

Details
The WCGS began in 1960 with 3,524 male volunteers who were employed by 11 California companies. Subjects were 39 to 59 years old and free of heart disease as determined by electrocardiogram.
After the initial screening, the study population dropped to 3,154 and the number of companies to
10 because of various exclusions. The cohort comprised both blue- and white-collar employees.
At baseline the following information was collected: socio-demographic including age, education, marital status, income, occupation; physical and physiological including height, weight, blood
pressure, electrocardiogram, and corneal arcus; biochemical including cholesterol and lipoprotein
fractions; medical and family history and use of medications; behavioral data including Type A
interview, smoking, exercise, and alcohol use. Later surveys added data on anthropometry, triglycerides, Jenkins Activity Survey, and caffeine use. Average follow-up continued for 8.5 years with
repeat examinations
